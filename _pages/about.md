Hi! I’m Krirk Nirunwiroj (*เกริก นิรันดร์วิโรจน์* in Thai). I grew up on a small, beautiful island—Phuket, Thailand—just an ordinary kid with big dreams. Thanks to a full scholarship from *the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research, and Innovation of Thailand*, I had the incredible opportunity to pursue my studies in the United States—a journey I’m truly grateful for.  

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science with a concentration in Human Language Technology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Computer Science and Data Science, with a certificate in Mathematics.

During my undergrad, I was incredibly lucky to have amazing mentors. I worked on NLP research under the mentorship of [Yun-Shiuan (Sean) Chuang](https://yunshiuan.github.io/), supervised by [Dr. Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/). I also had the privilege of learning from [Yuanru Tan](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/staff/tan-yuanru/) under the guidance of [Dr. David Williamson Shaffer](https://www.epistemicanalytics.org/staff/david-williamson-shaffer/) at the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://www.epistemicanalytics.org).

My interests span machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, computational social science, educational science, and medicine. While I’m still refining my research focus, I’m especially passionate about using **Large Language Models (LLMs) to make a real impact—particularly in education and healthcare.**  

Feel free to explore my website and reach out! I’d love to connect, share ideas, and learn from others. Thanks for stopping by!
