Let me share a bit about myself. I hail from the beautiful island of Phuket, Thailand, a place known for its stunning beaches and warm hospitality. My journey brought me to the USA, thanks to a full scholarship from The Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research, and Innovation of Thailandâ€”a wonderful opportunity that I'm truly grateful for.

At present, I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm passionately pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Data Science, alongside earning a certificate in Mathematics. My current interests are broadly in the area of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing.

Feel free to explore my website, where you'll find more about my academic pursuits and interests. I'm excited to connect and share my experiences with you. Thanks for stopping by!
